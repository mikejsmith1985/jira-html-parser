# GitHub Issue Images Skill

**Auto-activates when**: User mentions viewing/checking/fetching images or screenshots from GitHub issues

## Skill Directive

When a user asks to view/check/fetch images from a GitHub issue:

### Step 1: Fetch the Issue
Use `github-mcp-server-issue_read` with method: "get" to get issue details.

### Step 2: Extract Image URLs
Parse the issue body for image URLs matching:
- `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/*`
- `https://github.com/*/assets/*`
- `![]()` markdown image syntax
- `<img src="">` HTML syntax

### Step 3: Fetch Each Image
For each image URL found, use `web_fetch` with the image URL.

**CRITICAL**: GitHub issue images are PUBLIC and do NOT require authentication. They are served from CDN URLs accessible to anyone.

### Step 4: Display Results
Describe each image's content to the user.

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS TRY TO FETCH FIRST** - Never claim you can't access GitHub issue images without attempting
2. **GitHub CDN is PUBLIC** - No authentication required for user-images.githubusercontent.com
3. **Use web_fetch for images** - It works with githubusercontent.com URLs
4. **Parse the issue body** - Image URLs are in the body text, extract them with regex

## WRONG Response (Never Do This)
❌ "I can see the issue but not the screenshot URLs directly"
❌ "I can't fetch the screenshot"
❌ "I don't have access to external images"

## CORRECT Response Pattern
1. Call `github-mcp-server-issue_read` (method: "get", issue_number: N)
2. Parse response body for URLs matching `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/...`
3. Call `web_fetch` on each image URL
4. Describe what you see in the images
