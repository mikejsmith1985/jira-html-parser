# Release v0.5.16

## New Features
- **Field-to-Instance Association (ServiceNow)**: You can now associate specific custom fields with a specific Base URL (Instance). 
    - When editing a field, choose an instance from the dropdown.
    - Fields restricted to an instance will only appear in the "Add Field" list when that Base URL is selected.
    - Fields with no association remain Global (available for all instances).
- **Improved Dropdown Sorting**: Field dropdowns are now sorted alphabetically.
