# Release v0.5.5

## 💅 Improvements

### UI Improvements
- **Wider Field Selection**: Increased the width of the field selection dropdown (from 150px to 250px) to better accommodate longer field names.
- **Container Sizing**: Adjusted the main container width to `90%` with a maximum of `1200px`. This provides a responsive layout that uses most of the screen while maintaining pleasant side margins ("borders") on larger displays.
